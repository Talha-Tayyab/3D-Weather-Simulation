# 3D Weather Simulation using Three.js

## Overview

This project showcases a 3D weather simulation using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for 3D graphics in web applications. The simulation allows users to experience various weather conditions like rain, snow, fog, cloudy skies, thunderstorms, and windy conditions, complete with dynamic effects and lighting. Users can also control the intensity, speed, wind, and time of day settings.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [https://github.com/Talha-Tayyab/3D-Weather-Simulation](https://github.com/Talha-Tayyab/3D-Weather-Simulation) to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Controls

- **Weather Conditions**: Use the buttons to switch between different weather conditions.
- **Intensity**: Adjust the weather intensity using the slider.
- **Speed**: Control the speed of the weather elements with the speed slider.
- **Wind**: Modify the wind speed with the wind slider.
- **Time of Day**: Toggle between day and night modes using the dropdown menu.
- **Grid**: Use the "Toggle Grid" button to show or hide the ground grid for better spatial understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to create and render the 3D weather simulation.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the structure and styling of the user interface.

## Features

- **Scene Setup**: Initializes the 3D scene, camera, and renderer.
- **Lighting**: Includes ambient and directional lighting that adjusts based on the time of day.
- **Dynamic Weather Conditions**: Offers various weather simulations including:
  - Rainy
  - Snowy
  - Foggy
  - Cloudy
  - Thunderstorm
  - Windy
- **User Controls**: Interactive controls for adjusting weather parameters and time of day.
- **Animation**: Smooth animations of weather elements and wind effects.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file defining the structure of the webpage, including links to scripts and styles.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements and controls.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for setting up the scene, weather effects, user controls, and animations.

## Credits

This project acknowledges the following resources:

- **Three.js**: [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/)
- **WebGL**: For enabling hardware-accelerated 3D graphics rendering in the browser.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the project by modifying the `script.js` file. Changes to weather types, element intensities, player speed, and other parameters can be made there.
